Noise Removal and Image Denoising using Deep Learning

**Description**

This project aims to demonstrate the removal of noise from images using deep learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is the MNIST dataset, which has been altered to include noise to simulate real-world scenarios where images are degraded by noise. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising autoencoder is implemented to restore the original image quality.

The project serves as a practical application of deep learning for image enhancement and aims to assist in improving image quality for better analysis, particularly useful in computer vision tasks where high-quality images are needed.

**Features**

Dataset Preparation: The MNIST dataset is modified to include Gaussian noise, simulating noisy images for denoising tasks.

Denoising Autoencoder: A convolutional neural network-based autoencoder is designed to learn how to remove noise from images.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using image quality metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

**Technologies Used
**
Python programming language.

TensorFlow and Keras for building the neural network.

NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.

Matplotlib for visualizing results.

**Results**

The model was trained to denoise the noisy MNIST images effectively.

The evaluation metrics showed significant improvement in the quality of restored images, with MSE and PSNR used to quantify the model's success.

**Future Improvements**

Advanced Architectures: Use more advanced architectures like U-Net for improved denoising.

Additional Noise Types: Experiment with different noise types, such as salt-and-pepper and speckle noise, to improve model robustness.

Real-World Data: Test the model on real-world noisy images to evaluate its generalization capability.
